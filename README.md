In this repository, you will find all the code necessary to reproduce the figures, tables and general results for our paper *Improving replicability in single-cell RNA-Seq cell type discovery with __Dune__*.  In particular, it relies on two other repository to analyse datasets ([1](https://github.com/HectorRDB/Pipeline_Brain), [2](https://github.com/HectorRDB/Pancreas)). 

The preprint on Biorxiv can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.974220v1) and the __Dune__ package is available [here](https://hectorrdb.github.io/Dune/).
